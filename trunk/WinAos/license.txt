Oberon is the name of a modern integrated software environment. It is a single-user, 
multi-tasking system that runs on bare hardware or on top of a host operating system. 
Oberon is also the name of a programming language in the Pascal/Modula tradition. 
The Oberon project was launched in 1985 by Niklaus Wirth and Jürg Gutknecht.

Voyager is a project to explore the feasibility of a portable and extensible system 
for simulation and data analysis systems. It is mainly written in and for Oberon. 
The Voyager project is carried out by StatLab Heidelberg and was launched 
in 1993 by Günther Sawitzki.
